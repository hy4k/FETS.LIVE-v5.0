# 🔔 Functional Notification System - Documentation

## Overview

The FETS.LIVE notification system provides real-time, intelligent alerts from all important features across the platform. It replaces the static "FETS NEWS" banner with a dynamic, priority-based notification center.

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Files:
1. **`src/hooks/useNotifications.ts`**
   - Custom React hook for notification management
   - Fetches from 7 different data sources
   - Handles priority sorting and filtering
   - Provides state management functions

2. **`src/components/NotificationBanner.tsx`**
   - Main notification UI component
   - Collapsed and expanded view modes
   - Interactive notification cards
   - Responsive grid layout

#### Modified Files:

### Data Sources

The system queries the following Supabase tables:

1. **`incidents`** - Critical and pending incidents
2. **`sessions`** - Today's exams and upcoming sessions
3. **`checklist_instances`** - Incomplete checklists
4. **`candidates`** - New registrations
5. **`news_updates`** - System announcements

### Notification Types

```typescript
interface Notification {
  id: string
  type: 'incident' | 'exam' | 'candidate' | 'checklist' | 'system' | 'news'
  priority: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
  title: string
  message: string
  link?: string // Navigation target
  timestamp: string
  isRead: boolean
  icon: string // Icon name
  color: string // Color scheme
}
```

### Priority Sorting Algorithm

```typescript
const priorityOrder = { critical: 0, high: 1, medium: 2, low: 3 }
// Sort by priority first, then by timestamp
notifications.sort((a, b) => {
  if (priorityOrder[a.priority] !== priorityOrder[b.priority]) {
    return priorityOrder[a.priority] - priorityOrder[b.priority]
  }
  return new Date(b.timestamp).getTime() - new Date(a.timestamp).getTime()
})
```
